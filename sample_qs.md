1) How do you create a content view list with filtering based on starting alphabet from A-Z? <br>
  a) Create a view display block, create a header with A-Z and have a context filter starting with character.<br>
  b) create an attachment to content view display and filter from A-Z.<br>
  c) Enable "glossary" view in view's list because it has alphabetical filtering<br>
